usertrap() called syscall().


p->trapframe->a7 has value 7. 7 is the value of SYS_exec,
and it would be used to find the sys_exec() system call.


sstatus has value 0x200000022,
and the SPP bit (the 8th bit, starting from 0) is 0,
which means the previous mode is user mode.
NOTE: check the document in riscv-privileged, 4.1 Supervisor CSRs,
4.1.1 Supervisor Status Register (sstatus).

The kernel crashes because address 0 is unused,
and visiting address 0 would be invalid memory access.
And this is reflected in the value of scause, 0xd (13 in decimal).
This value means "Load page fault" when interrupt is disabled.


The name of the process is "initcode". And its pid is 1.
